Looking out in the real world, there are no applications or implementations (as far as we know) that allow users to collaborate on small to medium size projects. Those are only served for big size projects where the stakes are high and involve billions of rupiahs (ex. tender project). This cemented our idea to make an application specifically for this problem.



## Machine Learning Model
We will use the Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) model. The input for this model is the item vector consisting of the user ID and project ID, and the true label represents the interaction between the user and the item.
